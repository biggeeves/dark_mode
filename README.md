# Dark Mode

Change the colors (background, text and links) of REDCap.

There are settings for
User Names:  Specify specific users that should see the Dark Skin Mode. 
If left black only admins will 

Background Primary Color: The main background color.

Background Secondary and Tertiary colors are more than just background colors.  They are also the colors of hovers, roll overs, pop ups, modals, button backgrounds and a touch of other things.

Background Brightness: More than one background color is needed to create effects like buttons.
Options are: 
a. Same Color as Primary Background
b. Lighter
c. Darker
d. Specify

Choosing Lighter or Dark will open a field where the percent brightness change is set
Set this from 0% to 100%.  For example 10% darker will have buttons that are 10% darker than the background
 

Choose "Specify" to set your own secondary and tertiary colors which are mainly used for buttons and pop ups

Primary Text Color.  Specify the color that most text should be in REDCap.
